# watermeterreader
Prototype raspberry pi project to read analogue water meters in real-time

# About this project
A DIY project that allows you to track water usage of your home (or facility) in real-time.

# Overview
- A picture is taken every X seconds by raspberry pi
- The picture is analised with OpenCV and digits are extracted
- The digits are saved in CSV file
- A data munging & visualisation script cleans the data and plots graphs of liters used per hour.

# Current challenges
- User Interface, data munging & visualisation: there is currently no UI. I use Jupter Notebook to analyse the data. The data.csv file is copied manually from Raspberry PI to Mac. This could be done in a web server.
- Scalability: This is a prototype and not yet at a stage to scale. There are many types of analogue water meters. Manual setup in the physical world is required and adjustments to he scripts are currently necessary. 
- Accuracy of reading: A higher quality camera would allow beter image definition and more accurate readings.
